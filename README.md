# PcComponent â€“ Java JPA Assignment Project

This project is a simple application built using **Java** and **JPA (Java Persistence API)**. It was developed as a part of a coding assignment and demonstrates how to model and manage computer components (such as CPUs, RAM, motherboards, etc.) using entity classes and database transactions.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose & Objectives

- To practice the use of JPA for entity modeling and database operations.
- To understand how to persist Java objects into a relational database using `EntityManager`.
- To implement basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- To learn how to manage transactions with `EntityTransaction` (begin, commit, rollback).
